   <li>What is a Sell?</li>
            ~ Sell is he other side of the financial market, which deals with the creation, promotion, and selling of traded securities to the public.
   <li>How to use both to make money?</li>
            ~ Much depends on an investor's risk tolerance and time horizonâ€”that is, how long they can afford to wait for the stock to earn, & vice versa how much profit they want to earn.
